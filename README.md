# ballot-tabulator-verilog
The project involved designing a Ballot Tabulator capable of electronically recording and counting votes for three candidates, using a state machine-based digital logic system. It also included logic to manage state transitions—such as idle, vote, hold, and finish—to ensure smooth and accurate vote processing.

The design was implemented using a Finite State Machine (FSM) model in Verilog HDL, with clearly defined states, inputs, and outputs to handle candidate selection, debouncing, and vote completion. A testbench was developed to simulate various voting scenarios, verifying the accuracy of vote counting and state transitions.

This project demonstrates practical knowledge of Verilog programming, FSM-based design, and digital system simulation. The completed design ensures reliable, glitch-free electronic voting with a modular structure that can be extended for additional candidates or advanced features like authentication and encryption.
